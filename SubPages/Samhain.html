			<section>
				<p>It is the most important Celtic 	holiday of the pagan period in Europe until its conversion to Christianity ("All Saints' Day"), in which the night of October 31 to November 1 served as a celebration of the end of the season of harvests in the Celtic culture and was considered as the «Celtic New Year», which began with the dark season. It is both a party of transition (the passage from one year to another) and opening to the other world.</p>
				<p>Christianity:
				Pope Boniface IV (615) transformed a Greco-Roman temple dedicated to all gods (pantheon) into a Christian temple, dedicated to "All Saints' Day", to all those who had preceded them in the faith. And he ordered that the Feast of "All Saints" be celebrated universally.</p>
				<p>This vigil vigil the day before the feast of All Saints, within the English culture is called ba "All Hallow's Eve", Vigil of All Saints, which ended up being called "Halloween."</p>
