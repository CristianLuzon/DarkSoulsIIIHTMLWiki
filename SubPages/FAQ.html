					<strong>CURIOSITIES:</strong>
				</span>
				</p id="“witch”">
					The Origin of the Word “Witch”
					The word “witch” comes from the Old English wicce, meaning “wise woman.” The plural for wicce is wiccan. Wiccan were highly respected people at one time. According to popular belief, witches held one of their two main meetings, or sabbats, on Halloween night.
				</p>
				<p id="owls">
					Owls and Halloween
					Owls are associated with Halloween because, in Medieval Europe, owls were thought to be witches. To hear an owl’s call meant someone was about to die.
				</p>
				<p id="jack">
					Jack O’ Lanterns
					Jack O’ Lanterns are pumpkins with a lighted candle inside. According to Irish legend, Jack O’ Lanterns are named after a stingy man named Jack who, because he tricked the devil several times, was forbidden entrance into both heaven and hell. Therefore, he was condemned to wander the Earth, waving his lantern to lead people away from their paths.
				</p>
				<p id="bonfires">
					The Origin of Bonfires
					During the celebration of Samhain, bonfires were lit to ensure the sun would return after the long, hard winter. Often Druid priests would throw the bones of cattle into the flames – “bone fire” became “bonfire.”
				</p>
				<p id="candy">
					The History of Candy Corn
					Candy Corn was invented by George Renninger, a candy maker at the Wunderle Candy Company of Philadelphia in the 1880s. Candy Corn was originally called “butter cream candies” and “chicken feed” because corn was commonly used as food for livestock. They even had a rooster on the candy boxes. Candy Corn had no association with Halloween or fall, and was sold seasonally from March to November. After World War II, advertisers began marketing it as a special Halloween treat due to its colors that match those of the fall harvest.
				</p>
				<p id="tot">
					The History of Trick-or-Treating
					Trick-or-treating has been around for a long time, with versions existing since medieval times. Originally, it was called “guising” and children and poor adults wore costumes and begged for food or money in exchange for songs or prayers during Hallowmas. This practice was also called “souling.”
