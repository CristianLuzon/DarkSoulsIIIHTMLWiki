				<p>Dating back to European traditions, Halloween originated from the ancient Gaelic festival, Samhain. It was a day to celebrate the end of the harvest season – it means “summer's end”.

				It is thought that the Pagan Samhain was Christianised into Halloween by the early Christian church, and modern day customs have their roots in early folklore, Pagan beliefs and early Christianity.

				The word Halloween itself is a Scottish term for All Hallows Eve - basically, the evening before All Saints' Day. 

				Historically Gaels thought the walls between the spiritual realm and our world were thin. In order to protect their crops, they would set up places at their dinner tables for good spirits and light bonfires to scare off evil spirits.

				Trick or treating and dressing up came from 16th Century Ireland, Scotland and Wales. People would ask for food in exchange for a poem or song. People dressed up in scary costumes and impersonated the souls of the dead to protect themselves.
